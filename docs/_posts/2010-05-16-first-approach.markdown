I'm writing this in english as an excersice. I started learning programming around 2004. This was during secondary school in Argentina.  Why programming? It was included in my electronics curricula. After having fun designing electronic circuits and soldered electronic boards, I learned that computers could be programmed... First approach was something like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
