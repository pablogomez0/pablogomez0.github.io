This was written in English as an exercise. Pablo started learning programming around 2004. That was during his time in secondary school in Argentina. Why programming? It was included in the electronics curriculum. After having fun designing electronic circuits and soldering electronic boards, Pablo learned that computers could be programmed. His first approach to programming was this simple C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hola Pablo\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Learning this opened up the horizon of Pabloâ€™s mind. It was clear that computers could be programmed quite easily. After that first realization, Pablo learned about Object-Oriented Programming and Web Development with C# and .NET. During his academic studies, Pablo deepened his interest in computers and programming. He got his first programming job while studying at university. The following code snippets became familiar to Pablo around that time.

First with C#,
```csharp
using System;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hola Pablo");
    }
}
```
And then with Java.
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hola Pablo");
    }
}
```

Learning web development led Pablo to learn Javascript, so syntax like the following started making sense.
```javascript
console.log("Hola Pablo");
```
